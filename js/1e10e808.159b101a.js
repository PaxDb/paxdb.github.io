This is merely\n          a\n          tendency, of course, and numerous exceptions to this assumption exist. However, globally, the abundance\n          ratios of functionally interacting proteins are clearly closer to one than those of randomly chosen\n          protein\n          pairs, and this signal can be used to provide a relative ranking between datasets, given a constant and\n          externally provided network of functional links between proteins.
